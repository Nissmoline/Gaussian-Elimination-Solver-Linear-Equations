Program for Solving a System of Linear Algebraic Equations using Gaussian Elimination (6.2.1)

   Input data  
   • order of the system n;  
   • system matrix A;  
   • right-hand side of the system b;  
   • precision ε (for iterative methods).  
   
   Output data  
   • intermediate vectors and matrices;  
   • system solution;  
   • residuals.  
   
   For the matrix:  
   {
   3.1x₁ + 2.8x₂ + 1.9x₃ = 0.2  
   1.9x₁ + 3.1x₂ + 2.1x₃ = 2.1  
   7.5x₁ + 3.8x₂ + 4.8x₃ = 5.6  
   }
